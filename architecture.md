         community-of-practice activity, front-door and engagement logs.

                     ↓

Level 2 — Data maturity (1 → 5)
-------------------------------
Uses | Data | Leadership | Culture | Tools | Skills

Sources: data-maturity assessments, staff surveys, tooling adoption,
         evidence of leadership use of data in forums and decisions.

                     ↓

Level 3 — Outcomes & impact
---------------------------
Financial savings | Efficiency | Time savings
User satisfaction | Public good contribution

Sources: benefits logs, service KPIs, time studies, reuse metrics,
         cross-government collaboration and impact stories.


THEORY OF CHANGE (ValueLine)
----------------------------
Inputs (L1) → Outputs (L1/L2) → Outcomes (L3) → Impact (L3)
Foundations enable maturity; maturity enables outcomes; outcomes create public value.


EXECUTIVE DECISION BOX
----------------------
• Top 3 asks of the board
• Key dependencies and trade-offs
• Confidence in evidence (L1 / L2 / L3)
• Forward look – now / next / later
