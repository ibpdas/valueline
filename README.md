## 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

Public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the link between data work and real impact is often unclear.  

Foundational activities are essential, yet their contribution to maturity and outcomes is hard to see.  

That leads to misaligned expectations, duplicated effort, slower impact and results that are harder to sustain.

> ValueLine brings together a causal model, a delivery focussed dashboard and a lightweight methodology to show where value is emerging, how maturity is shifting and where leadership action is needed to accelerate the path to impact.

It turns data strategy alive and actionable, surfacing early signals and keeping federated teams aligned around a shared picture of progress.


---

## 1. What problem this model solves

In federated organisations, no single team controls the full data value chain.  

This creates persistent challenges:

- **Unclear attribution** between foundational work and outcomes  
- **Competing priorities** that dilute focus  
- **Fragmented collaboration** across teams and functions  

When the line of sight is weak, organisations:

- Focus effort in the wrong places  
- Misread progress  
- Invest without addressing root causes  
- Create short term fixes that become long term bottlenecks  
- Experience delayed or diluted impact
- Struggle to scale beyond pilots

### How ValueLine addresses this

ValueLine breaks the journey into three causal levels:

- **Level 1: Foundations** — what data and partner teams directly shape  
- **Level 2: Maturity** — how the organisation behaves when foundations take hold  
- **Level 3: Outcomes** — the measurable value that emerges later  

This helps leaders understand:

- What unlocks value now vs later  
- Why early signals matter even when outcomes lag  
- Where dependencies and decisions sit  
- How different results move at different speeds  

---

### ❗ What ValueLine isn’t

To avoid confusion, ValueLine is **not**:

- a valuation framework  
- a capability or maturity model (e.g., DAMA, DCAM)  
- a regulatory or compliance scorecard  
- a substitute for technical standards, governance or assurance  

ValueLine does **not** estimate economic value, audit capability or assign scores.

Its purpose is simpler:  
> to accelerate the path to value by explaining how foundational work leads to maturity, behaviour change and outcomes in federated organisations.

---

## 2. How the model works

ValueLine uses a simple causal chain to explain how foundational work turns into maturity, behaviour change and measurable public value across a federated organisation.

The model is built around **three levels**, the **shifts** that signal progress, the **indicators** that show pacing, the **evidence types** that build confidence, and a light-touch **theory of change** that ties everything together.

---

### 2.1 The three levels — what changes over time

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, ownership, common platforms and standards, communities and engagement.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
How the organisation behaves when foundations take hold: reuse, interoperability, confidence, collaboration and evidence-informed decisions.

**Level 3 — Outcomes & impact**  
Savings, time reduction, efficiency, improved services and public good impact.

> A clean chain: **foundations → maturity → outcomes & impact**.

---

### 2.2 The shifts that matter — how you know the system is changing

ValueLine focuses on **shifts**, not scores.  
These shifts are early, visible signs that the organisation is moving in the right direction.

#### **Level 1 — Foundational enabler shifts**  
Early conditions shaped by data leaders and partner teams:

- **Strategy** — isolated priorities → shared cross-cutting priorities  
- **Leadership** — “their data problem” → shared ownership and accountability  
- **Foundation** — fragmented fixes → common policies, platforms and standards  
- **Community** — pockets of innovation → shared practice and reusable capabilities  
- **Engagement** — ad-hoc conversations → ongoing cross-functional engagement  

#### **Level 2 — Maturity shifts**  
How the organisation behaves when Level 1 takes effect  
(aligned to the *Data Maturity Assessment for Government, 2023*):

- **Uses** — reactive reporting → proactive operational and strategic use  
- **Data** — inconsistent → coherent, reusable and interoperable  
- **Leadership** — passive → active sponsorship and expectation-setting  
- **Culture** — low confidence → everyday data informed decisions  
- **Tools** — fragmented → discoverable, integrated and self-service  
- **Skills** — pockets of expertise → widespread literacy and continuous learning  

#### **Level 3 — Outcome and impact shifts**  
As Levels 1 and 2 strengthen, public value moves in predictable ways:

- **Financial savings** — isolated wins → organisation wide efficiencies  
- **User satisfaction** — anecdotal → measurable, repeatable improvements  
- **Efficiency gains** — local wins → system wide improvements  
- **Time savings** — task based → end to end workflow optimisation  
- **Public good impact** — occasional → continuous contributions to policy and services  

---

### 2.3 Indicators — how fast results appear

Different types of results appear at different speeds:

- **Leading indicators** — early signs foundations are forming  
- **Signal indicators** — behavioural and system changes  
- **Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

> These pacing differences prevent premature pressure for outcomes before the system is ready.

---

### 2.4 Mixed-method measurement — how confidence builds

ValueLine uses a rounded evidence approach:

- **Quantitative** — adoption, reuse, savings, usage  
- **Qualitative** — sentiment, user research, case studies  
- **Economic / experimental** — BCR, NPV, counterfactuals  

> No single metric captures capability or public value. Mixed evidence builds a more credible picture.

---

### 2.5 Theory of change — the connective logic

A simple, lightweight chain sits underneath the model:

- **If** Level 1 improves  
- **then** Level 2 strengthens  
- **which enables** Level 3 outcomes to appear  
- **subject to** leadership decisions, constraints and system conditions  

> This shifts ValueLine from a descriptive diagram into a practical decision tool.

---

### 2.6 Bias prompts — decision hygiene for interpreting progress

The dashboard includes small **bias prompt cards** to support interpretation and prioritisation.  
They help teams avoid common judgement traps when reviewing evidence, selecting shifts or interpreting early signals.

Examples include:

- cobra effect  
- Goodhart’s law  
- availability bias  
- present bias  
- sunk cost fallacy  
- optimism bias  

> These prompts keep discussions grounded and help leaders make clearer, more transparent decisions.

---

## 3. Leadership value & responsibilities

### 3.1 What leaders get from ValueLine

The **Executive Decision Box** distils what leaders need to steer the system:

- essential decisions  
- trade offs and dependencies  
- confidence levels  
- now / next / later priorities  

> It makes early change visible, a key trigger for confidence and alignment.

### 3.2 What ValueLine requires from leaders

ValueLine works when leaders:

- confirm ownership and decision rights  
- back shared foundations over local optimisation  
- unblock cross team dependencies  
- retire duplicative tools when common capabilities exist  
- reinforce evidence informed decisions and reuse  

---

## 4. Why this model works

ValueLine works because it reflects how change actually happens in complex public sector systems.  

It clarifies contribution, sets realistic expectations and makes early signals visible — all of which are essential in federated organisations where no single team controls the whole value chain.

It works by:

- grounding progress in **shifts**, not scores  
- linking foundations → maturity → outcomes with a clean causal chain  
- showing **early signs** of value before outcomes appear  
- reducing misaligned effort and duplicated activity  
- creating a shared language that strengthens collaboration across teams  

Most importantly, it keeps strategy **alive**.  

By surfacing early movement and emerging signals, ValueLine prevents strategy from becoming shelfware and turns it into a practical tool for alignment and decision making.

---

### 4.1 Why this matters in federated organisations

Federated organisations rarely move as a single system.  
Each directorate or ALB operates with its own pressures, timelines and constraints, which makes alignment, pacing and interpretation of progress particularly challenging.

ValueLine helps by creating a shared way to:

- make foundational work visible even when delivered by different teams  
- spot misaligned or duplicated effort early  
- connect local wins to organisation-wide outcomes  
- reduce narrative drift when groups interpret progress differently  
- keep expectations realistic without slowing ambition  

> In federated systems, the goal is not uniformity, the goal is **coherence**.  

ValueLine provides the structure that makes that possible.

## 5. How to use the model in practice

Different groups use the model in different ways depending on what they are accountable for.

| Users | How they use it | What they care about |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Executives and senior leaders** | Understand root causes, their roles in shifts | Trade offs, prioritisation, impact |
| **CDO and data leadership teams** | Foundations, shifts, sequencing, dependency mapping | Alignment, realistic delivery plans, early signals, cross team clarity |
| **Portfolio, PMO, finance and benefits teams** | Causal chain, indicators, contribution to impact | Investment rationale, duplication, benefits evidence |
| **Cross functional delivery teams** | Understand their part in the system | Blockers, adoption, dependencies, reuse |
| **ALBs and federated partners** | A consistent view of maturity and outcomes without league tables | Autonomy with alignment, transparency, predictable collaboration |

---

### Using the dashboard in sessions

When running workshops or leadership conversations:

1. Start with the high level story (Levels 1, 2, 3).  
2. Walk through the Executive Decision Box.  
3. Review leading and signal indicators before lagging metrics.  
4. Use the **bias prompt cards** as a short decision hygiene step:  
   - “If this bias were present, how would it distort what we are seeing?”  

This keeps conversations grounded and reduces misinterpretation of early signals.

## 10. Why I created ValueLine

Across federated teams and dozens of data strategies, I kept seeing the same pattern:

- strong foundational work  
- unclear value story  
- drifting expectations  
- late value signals  
- weak connection between foundations, maturity and outcomes  

ValueLine is my way of making that connection clearer and more usable, shaped through trial and error, reflection and generous guidance from colleagues.

If it helps teams focus on what matters and communicate impact with greater confidence, it will have done its job.

If useful, here is a short talk where I share some of the thinking that influenced this model:
