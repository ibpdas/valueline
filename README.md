## 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

Public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the link between data work and real impact is often unclear.

Foundational activities are essential, yet their contribution to maturity, behaviour change and public value is hard to see.  
This creates unclear expectations, late value signals and inconsistent support.

**ValueLine** gives a clear, plain-English line of sight from foundations → maturity → outcomes.  
It shows what’s changing, why different results move at different speeds, and what leaders need to focus on now, next and later.

It grew out of seeing strong foundational work being delivered, but the story of progress remaining hard to explain.

---

## 1. What problem this model solves

In federated organisations, no single team controls the data value chain.  
This creates three persistent challenges:

- **Unclear attribution** between foundational work and outcomes  
- **Competing priorities** that dilute focus
- **Fragmented collaboration** across teams and functions

When the line of sight is weak, organisations:

- Focus effort in the wrong places  
- Misread progress  
- Imvest without addressing root causes  
- Experience delayed or diluted impact  
- Create quick fixes that become future bottlenecks 

### How ValueLine addresses this

ValueLine breaks the journey into three causal levels:

- **Level 1: Foundations** — what data and partner teams directly shape  
- **Level 2: Maturity** — how the organisation behaves when foundations take hold  
- **Level 3: Outcomes** — the measurable value that emerges later  

This helps leaders understand:

- what unlocks value now vs later  
- why early signals matter even when outcomes lag  
- where dependencies and decisions sit  
- how different results move at different speeds  

### What ValueLine is (and isn’t)

A **causal explanation and decision tool**, not a benchmark or capability model.  
It complements existing frameworks by explaining **how value actually flows** in a federated environment.

---

## 2. How the model works

ValueLine combines three levels, three indicators and three measurement methods, all tied together by a simple theory of change.

---

### 2.1 The three levels — what changes over time

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, leadership, standards, platforms, communities of practice.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
Reuse, interoperability, confidence, evidence-informed decisions, stronger collaboration.

**Level 3 — Outcomes**  
Savings, time reduction, efficiency, improved services, public good impact.

> A clean chain: foundations → maturity → outcomes → impact.

---

### 2.2 The three indicators — how fast results appear

**Leading indicators** — early signs that Level 1 foundations are working  
**Signal indicators** — behavioural and system changes  
**Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

These explain why Level 3 cannot appear before Level 1 and Level 2 shifts.

---

### 2.3 The three measurement methods — how evidence builds

ValueLine uses a mixed evidence approach:

- **Quantitative** — savings, adoption, reuse, usage  
- **Qualitative** — sentiment, user research, case studies  
- **Economic/experimental** — BCR, NPV, counterfactuals  

---

### 2.4 Theory of change wrapper — the connective logic

- **If** foundations improve  
- **then** maturity strengthens  
- **which enables** outcomes to appear  
- **subject to** leadership decisions, constraints and system conditions  

This turns ValueLine into a decision tool rather than a descriptive diagram.

---

## 3. Executive decision box

The **Executive Decision Box** translates insights into simple leadership asks:

- essential decisions  
- trade offs and dependencies  
- confidence levels  
- now / next / later priorities  

In a federated system, this is crucial — value depends on decisions across many teams, not just the data function.

It also **makes early change visible**, which is often what shifts mindsets, builds support and accelerates culture change.

---

## 4. Why this model works

ValueLine works because it:

- reflects how federated organisations actually operate  
- clarifies contribution vs attribution  
- sets realistic expectations on pacing  
- makes invisible value visible  
- focuses attention on the shifts that matter most  
- reduces repeated work and misaligned effort  

Most importantly, it keeps strategy **alive**.

By connecting strategy to real time signals of change, ValueLine prevents strategy becoming shelfware.  
It becomes a living tool for action, alignment and collaboration.

---

## 4.1 What this model requires from leaders

ValueLine only works when leaders act on what it surfaces.  
This can mean:

- Clear ownership of data domains and standards  
- Prioritising shared foundations over local optimisation  
- Fast resolution of cross team dependencies
- Aligned budgets and resources for Level 1 and Level 2 work  
- Consistent reinforcement of reuse, interoperability and evidence led decisions  

Without these leadership actions, foundations stall and outcomes lag — regardless of technical effort.

---

## 5. How to use the model in practice

ValueLine helps teams:

- Explain data strategy impact clearly and credibly  
- Engage leaders with realistic pacing and evidence  
- Decide whether to prioritise foundations or maturity  
- Align directorates and ALBs without league tables  

Useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- PMO, governance and portfolio groups  
- Strategy, policy and finance partners  
- Change and benefit managment teams

## 8. Limitations

- Synthetic data only  
- Not a scorecard or benchmark  
- Attribution remains approximate  
- Evidence quality improves over time  
- Outcomes lag, sometimes by years  
- Maturiry scores are directional  

Use alongside your own evidence, governance and judgement.

---

## 9. Contributing and reuse

You are welcome to:

- fork and customise  
- propose improvements  
- share alternative layouts or metrics  

Attribution is optional but appreciated.

---

## 10. Why I created ValueLine

Across federated teams and dozens of data strategies, I kept seeing the same pattern:

- Strong foundational work  
- Unclead value story  
- Drifting expectations  
- Late value signals  
- Weak connection between foundations, maturity and outcomes  

ValueLine is my way of making that connection clearer and more usable.

If it helps teams focus on what matters and communicate impact with more confidence, it will have done its job.
