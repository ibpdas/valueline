# Model Department X - Data Strategy Impact Dashboard

A lightweight, executive friendly dashboard for public sector data leaders who want to show how data strategy work creates impact in a federated organisation.

This is a synthetic "model department" example. It gives you a starting point to build your own view of data strategy impact using a simple three level causal model and a mix of leading and lagging indicators.

## What this is

This project provides:

- A single page **HTML dashboard** you can open in any browser  
- A clear **three level causal model** for data strategy impact  
- A simple way to distinguish **leading, signal and lagging indicators**  
- Text that you can reuse and adapt for your own organisation  

It is designed for public sector settings where:

- Data leadership is **federated** across multiple directorates or ALBs  
- Control over outcomes is **partial**, shared with other functions  
- Senior leaders want to see **impact, maturity and trade offs** on one page  

All figures and examples are synthetic. They do not represent any real organisation.

## The three level causal model

The dashboard is built around three linked levels.

### Level 1 - Get the basics right

Foundational conditions under your direct control:

- Strategy  
- Shared leadership  
- Foundation  
- Community  
- Engagement  

These are shown as RAG rated pillar cards, each with a short "going well" and "needs attention" narrative. They are tagged as **LEADING** indicators because they describe conditions you can influence now.

### Level 2 - Enable maturity

System wide maturity across six themes:

- Uses  
- Data  
- Leadership  
- Culture  
- Tools  
- Skills  

Level 2 combines:

- A simple **radar view** of maturity levels (1 to 5)  
- A small table with notes for each theme  
- Badges that show whether each theme is **LEADING**, **SIGNAL** or **LAGGING**  

Level 2 is the bridge. It reflects the results of Level 1, and it shapes Level 3.

### Level 3 - Influence outcomes

Public value outcomes that are influenced by the first two levels:

- Financial savings  
- User satisfaction  
- Efficiency  
- Time savings  
- Public good  

These are all **LAGGING** indicators. They show realised value, not direct control.

This card also includes short **impact stories** that join up numbers and narratives, for example flood modelling and land data models.

## Executive decision box

The dashboard includes an **Executive decision box** card that lists live trade offs for senior leaders. For example:

- Balancing remediation and new capability  
- Prioritising standards versus urgent operational delivery  
- Allocating analytical capacity across competing demands  

This reminds readers that the purpose of the view is not just monitoring. It is there to support real choices.

## Measurement methods

The **Measurement methods** card shows how you might collect evidence over time:

- Reporting rhythms  
- Organisational insight  
- Adoption and capability  
- System behaviour  
- Public value  
- Benefits realisation  

Each line is tagged as **LEADING**, **SIGNAL** or **LAGGING** so you can see the mix at a glance. This is useful when you discuss evidence with finance, audit or strategy teams.

## How to use this template

You can use this in several ways:

1. **Quick start in a browser**

   - Save the HTML file as `index.html`  
   - Open it in any modern browser  
   - Change the text, numbers and labels directly in the file  

2. **Adapt for your organisation**

   - Replace the "Model Department X" naming  
   - Update the Level 1 pillars to match your strategy  
   - Adjust maturity levels and notes based on your own assessment  
   - Add your own impact stories, case studies and decisions  

3. **Link to spreadsheets and slides**

   - Use an Excel workbook to hold your underlying data  
   - Keep the HTML as a **front door** for senior audiences  
   - Recreate the layout in PowerPoint if you need slide ready visuals  

4. **Extend to Streamlit or other tools (optional)**

   - Use the same three level model as a design pattern  
   - Replace static figures with live data from your systems  
   - Keep the structure but allow departments or ALBs to filter their own view

## Who this is for

This template is aimed at:

- Chief Data Officers and Heads of Data in the public sector  
- Senior analysts and data leaders in federated organisations  
- Strategy, performance and portfolio teams who want a shared frame  

It is not a formal performance framework or benchmark. It is a **conversation tool** that helps people:

- See the link between foundations, maturity and outcomes  
- Talk about leading and lagging indicators in a clear way  
- Surface trade offs and decisions in a structured format  

---

## Limitations and responsible use

- All data and examples are **synthetic**  
- The dashboard is a **learning and facilitation tool**, not an official scorecard  
- Real decisions should still draw on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement  

Please adapt this with care and make sure any real figures are checked and agreed locally.

## Contributing and reuse

You are welcome to:

- Fork this and build your own version  
- Open issues or pull requests with improvements  
- Share alternative layouts or additional metrics to help other public sector teams  

If you reuse it, you do not need to credit the source, but a short note back is always appreciated.

## Author

Created by **Bandhu P. Das**, public sector data leader, qualified accountant, Imperial AI policy fellow 2025 and former DAMA UK committee member (2023-2024).

🎤 **BrightTalk Talk — “Unlocking the Value of Data - Lessons from Public Sector Data Business Cases”**  
https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/12405/602410

In this session, Bandhu explains why proving the value of data work is difficult in practice — especially in federated public sector organisations. He introduces the **Value Matrix**, a practical extension of the Treasury’s Five Case Model that incorporates engagement and change as essential enablers of impact.

Drawing on 15+ years across finance, policy and data, Bandhu discusses:
- why ROI and cost-benefit analysis only capture part of data’s value  
- how to articulate multi-dimensional benefits stakeholders can recognise  
- how to build high impact data business cases that secure investment  
- lessons from Defra and HM Treasury on creating enterprise level value  

This dashboard builds on the same principles: making data strategy, maturity and public value **visible, explainable and fundable** in complex organisations.
