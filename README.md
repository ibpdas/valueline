<h1 align="center">ValueLine: Data Strategy Impact Dashboard</h1>

<p align="center">
  A three level causal model to help public sector data leaders explain, track and demonstrate 
  data strategy impact in complex or federated organisations.
</p>

---

> ### 📌 Concept in 30 seconds
> This dashboard is the result of the **ValueLine data to impact model**.  

> It shows how data strategy activity and foundations (Level 1) lead to data maturity and system behaviour (Level 2) and ultimately public value outcomes (Level 3).
>  
> The shows a clear causal chain, a repeatable dashboard format, and a better way to have executive conversations, prioritise effort and make choices in federated organisations.

## 1. What the model solves  

Most public sector organisations find it difficult to show how data strategy activity leads to maturity and then to outcomes.  
The problem is attribution.  
Data teams usually control the inputs, but not the outcomes.

This model brings clarity by structuring the story into three causal levels:

1. **Level 1. Build the foundational enablers**  
   Conditions that data leaders and teams directly control.  
   These include strategy alignment, shared leadership, foundations, community and engagement.

2. **Level 2. Enable maturity**  
   How the wider system behaves when Level 1 is working.  
   Uses, data, leadership, culture, tools and skills develop toward a more capable and sustainable data ecosystem.

3. **Level 3. Influence outcomes**  
   Public value created when maturity is in place.  
   Financial savings, user satisfaction, time savings, operational efficiency and public good contributions.

This creates a clean chain of reasoning:  
**Level 1 activities shape Level 2 maturity, which influences Level 3 outcomes.**

## 2. The three levels at a glance

### Level 1. Build the foundational enablers  

Conditions under direct control. These unlock maturity.  

Examples:  
- Cross cutting data priorities  
- Shared ownership and decision making  
- Common foundations and standards  
- Strong data communities  
- Cross functional engagement  

### Level 2. Enable maturity  

System capability that emerges from earlier Level 1 work.  

This builds on the Government Data Maturity Framework (2023) with ratings from Level 1 (Beginning) to Level 5 (Mastering) across six themes:

- Uses  
- Data  
- Leadership  
- Culture  
- Tools  
- Skills  

### Level 3. Influence outcomes  

Public value indicators influenced by the first two levels:

- Financial savings  
- User satisfaction  
- Efficiency gains  
- Time savings  
- Public good impact across government  

---

## 3. Leading, signal and lagging indicators  

Each metric is classified so expectations are realistic:

- **Leading**: Early signs that enablers are working (mainly Level 1)  
- **Signal**: System response and behaviour change (mainly Level 2)  
- **Lagging**: Measurable public value and benefits (mainly Level 3)  

This helps avoid unrealistic pressure to show outcomes before foundations are in place.

---

## 4. Executive decision box  

The dashboard includes an **Executive decision box** to the right of Page 1.

It provides a dedicated space where leaders see:

- Top three asks  
- Key trade offs  
- Dependencies  
- Confidence levels in the evidence  
- Forward look priorities  

This translates data strategy into **concrete executive decisions and ownership**, instead of a generic performance report.

---

## 5. Measurement methods  

The Methodology page suggests practical measurement cycles, for example:

- Monthly performance reports  
- Quarterly senior leadership updates  
- Annual maturity review  
- Annual staff survey  
- Event and training participation  
- Standards adoption  
- Dataset and model reuse  
- Open data and API analytics  
- Post implementation reviews  
- Verified cost and time savings  

These give a balanced picture of both **capability building** and **value creation**.

---

## 6. Why this three level model works  

Behind the dashboard is a simple systems principle:  
foundations shape maturity, and maturity shapes outcomes.

This approach works because:

- foundations and outcomes move at different speeds  
- system behaviour lags behind system investment  
- maturity cannot exceed the strength of foundations  
- outcomes cannot exceed the maturity level  
- public value emerges from alignment, not random effort  
- the system is iterative, not linear  
- feedback from outcomes reshapes future foundations  
- in federated systems, Level 1 foundations are **co-designed** with partners based on Level 3 desired outcomes and existing Level 2 maturity  
- tensions, constraints and organisational realities influence which Level 1 enablers are feasible or prioritised  

These principles explain the structure of the dashboard and why it uses leading, signal and lagging indicators.

## 7. How this model is used  

This framework helps public sector teams:

- Explain data strategy impact using a simple causal chain  
- Engage senior leaders using a consistent, repeatable dashboard  
- Identify where to invest effort next in Level 1 or Level 2  
- Compare directorates or ALBs within federated departments  
- Move discussions away from “where are the outcomes” toward  
  “are the enablers and system conditions in place”  

It is especially useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- Portfolio, PMO and governance forums  
- Strategy, finance and risk partners  
- Internal performance and benefits leads

## 10. Limitations  

- All data and examples are **synthetic**  
- The dashboard is a **learning and facilitation tool**, not an official scorecard  
- It is not a benchmark, standard or assurance framework  
- Real decisions should still draw on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement  

Please adapt this with care and make sure any real figures are checked and agreed locally.

## 12. Author  

ValuLine model is created by **Bandhu P. Das**, public sector data leader, qualified accountant, Imperial AI policy fellow 2025 and former DAMA UK committee member (2023 to 2024).

🎤 **DAMA UK Talk – “Unlocking the Value of Data: Lessons from Public Sector Data Business Cases”**  
https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/12405/602410

In this session, Bandhu explains why demonstrating the value of data work is challenging in federated public sector organisations. He introduces a practical extension of the Treasury Five Case Model that brings engagement and change into the core of impact. Drawing on 15 years across finance, policy and data, his approach focuses on making data strategy, maturity and public value visible, explainable and fundable in complex organisations
