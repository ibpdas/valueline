# Concept in 30 seconds

**Public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the connection between foundational data work and visible impact is often unclear.**  

Foundations are invisible, maturity develops unevenly, and outcomes appear late, making it difficult to justify investment, prioritise the right work or read early signals of progress.

This leads to common system level challenges:

- foundational work feels abstract or undervalued  
- effort is duplicated across federated teams  
- progress is misread or interpreted inconsistently  
- outcomes take longer to appear  
- confidence drops before value becomes visible  

**ValueLine makes this pathway visible.**

It brings together three integrated components:

- a **strategic logic model** — showing how foundations strengthen maturity and enable outcomes  
- a **prioritisation & diagnostic framework** — identifying the shifts that truly unlock progress  
- a **performance & learning dashboard model** — using mixed evidence to build a credible value narrative  

Together, these create a clearer line of sight from foundational activity to practical impact — helping leaders focus on what matters most, at the right time, with shared confidence.

# 1. The problem ValueLine solves

In federated organisations, leadership ambition is high but ownership is distributed.  

No single team controls the full data value chain, which creates persistent challenges:

- unclear attribution between work and outcomes  
- duplicated efforts and inconsistent prioritisation  
- uneven maturity across teams  
- narrative drift on progress  
- delayed or weak value signals  

Without a clear line of sight, organisations:

- prioritise the wrong things  
- misinterpret slow moving outcomes  
- rely on anecdote rather than evidence  
- struggle to scale successful approaches  
- lose confidence in foundational work  

---

# 2. The three components

ValueLine is built on **three integrated components** that reflect how real progress emerges in complex systems.

---

## 2.1 Strategic logic model  
### *Make the value path clear*

The strategic logic model explains how **foundations enable maturity**, and how maturity enables **outcomes & impact**.

### **The three levels**

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, shared ownership, common platforms, reusable standards, communities and engagement.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
Reuse, interoperability, confident data culture, collaboration and evidence-informed decisions.

**Level 3 — Outcomes & impact**  
Efficiency, productivity, service quality, user satisfaction and public good impact.

A simple chain — **foundations → maturity → outcomes** — creates shared understanding across federated teams.

---

## 2.2 Prioritisation & diagnostic framework  
### *Focus effort where it matters most*

This component identifies **where the system is moving**, **why**, and **what actions unlock the most value**.

ValueLine focuses on **shifts**, not maturity scores.

### **Level 1 — Foundational enabler shifts**

- **Strategy** — isolated initiatives → shared, cross-cutting priorities  
- **Leadership** — “their data problem” → shared ownership and accountability  
- **Platforms & standards** — fragmented local fixes → common, reusable platforms and standards  
- **Community** — pockets of innovation → shared practice, knowledge exchange and reusable assets  
- **Engagement** — ad hoc conversations → ongoing, structured cross functional engagement  

### **Level 2 — Maturity shifts (aligned to 2023 Government Data Maturity themes)**

- **Uses** — reactive reporting → proactive, integrated use of data in decisions  
- **Data** — inconsistent, siloed → coherent, reusable and interoperable  
- **Leadership** — passive awareness → active sponsorship and clear expectations  
- **Culture** — low confidence → everyday, confident data-informed decisions  
- **Tools** — fragmented, hard to find → discoverable, integrated and self-service  
- **Skills** — pockets of expertise → widespread literacy and continuous learning  

### **Level 3 — Outcome & impact shifts**

- **Efficiency** — isolated wins → organisation wide time, cost and effort savings  
- **Experience** — anecdotal satisfaction → measurable improvements for users and colleagues  
- **Optimisation** — task level tweaks → end to end service and process optimisation  
- **Public good** — occasional impact stories → clear, sustained contribution to policy and services  

### **Indicators — understand pacing**

- **Leading indicators** — earliest signs foundations are forming  
- **Signal indicators** — behavioural and cultural changes  
- **Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

This prevents premature pressure on outcomes before the system is ready.

---

## 2.3 Performance & learning dashboard model  
### *Measure what matters, credibly*

ValueLine uses **mixed method evidence** to tell a rounded, reliable story of progress.

### **Evidence types**

- **Quantitative** — adoption, reuse, usage, cost reduction  
- **Qualitative** — interviews, sentiment, case studies, user research  
- **Experimental** — controlled comparisons, partner benchmarks, counterfactuals  

No single metric captures capability.  
Mixed evidence reduces fragility and builds leadership confidence.

---

# 3. Leadership value & responsibilities

### **What leaders gain**

- a clear causal view of progress and blockers  
- better prioritisation  
- early signals of value  
- structured trade offs  
- alignment across federated teams  

### **What ValueLine requires from leaders**

- reinforce shared foundations over local optimisation  
- confirm ownership and decision rights  
- unblock system wide dependencies  
- retire duplicative tools and pathways  
- role model evidence informed decision making  

---

# 4. Why ValueLine works

ValueLine reflects the realities of public sector change:

- foundations matter but take time  
- maturity emerges unevenly  
- outcomes lag  
- early signals drive confidence  
- federated teams need coherence more than uniformity  

ValueLine succeeds because it:

- clarifies contribution  
- reduces misinterpretation  
- reveals early value  
- aligns expectations  
- keeps strategy alive and useful  

In federated systems, **coherence is the goal**.  
ValueLine provides the structure that makes it possible.

# 5. How to use the model

### **Different groups use ValueLine differently**

| Users | How they use it | What they focus on |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Executives** | Understand causes, steer direction | Priorities, trade-offs, risks |
| **CDO & data leaders** | Shape foundations, track shifts | Dependencies, sequencing |
| **PMO & Finance** | Connect work → outcomes | Evidence, duplication, rationale |
| **Delivery teams** | Understand their role in the system | Adoption, blockers, reuse |
| **Federated partners** | Shared view without league tables | Coherence, autonomy, transparency |

### **Using ValueLine in sessions**

1. Start with Levels 1 → 2 → 3  
2. Review shifts and early signals  
3. Explore indicators (leading → signal → lagging)  
4. Use bias prompts to reduce misinterpretation

# 7. Limitations

ValueLine has important constraints:

- synthetic data only  
- attribution approximate  
- not a benchmark or maturity score  
- outcomes lag foundational work  
- evidence quality improves over time  

Use alongside judgement, governance and expertise.

# 9. Why I created ValueLine

I created ValueLine after seeing the same pattern across federated teams: strong foundational work, high ambition, but an unclear connection between effort and outcomes. The value story was often late, uneven or difficult to explain.

ValueLine distils the simple logic I kept drawing on whiteboards — foundations, maturity, outcomes — into a clearer way to understand progress and focus attention where it matters most.

If it helps even one leader see their system more clearly, or one team feel more confident in the value of their work, it will have done its job. I share it openly so others can refine it and shape it for the wider community.
