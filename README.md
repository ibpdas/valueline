   Enablers shape maturity.  
   Maturity influences outcomes.  
   Outcomes lag the most.

## Concept in 30 seconds

The ValueLine model shows how data strategy activity and foundational enablers (Level 1) lead to system maturity (Level 2) and ultimately to public value outcomes (Level 3).

It provides a clear causal chain, a repeatable dashboard format and a simple way to guide executive conversations. It helps shift the discussion from “where are the outcomes” to “are the enablers and system conditions in place”.

## 1. What the model solves

Public sector organisations often struggle to show how data activity leads to maturity and then to outcomes.  
The challenge is attribution. Data teams shape the inputs, not the outcomes.

This model structures the story into three causal levels.

### Level 1. Foundational enablers  
Conditions shaped by data leaders and teams. Examples include strategy alignment, shared leadership, common platforms and standards, communities of practice and cross functional engagement.

### Level 2. System maturity  
How the organisation behaves when Level 1 foundations begin to take effect.  
Assessed using the Government Data Maturity Framework.

### Level 3. Outcomes  
Public value created when maturity is in place.  
Includes financial savings, user satisfaction, time savings, efficiency and wider public good.

Level 1 shapes Level 2. Level 2 influences Level 3.

## 2. The three levels at a glance

### Level 1. Foundational enablers

Typical shifts include:

- Strategy: isolated priorities to shared direction  
- Leadership: “their data problem” to shared accountability  
- Foundation: fragmented fixes to common platforms and standards  
- Communities: isolated innovation to shared practice  
- Engagement: ad hoc conversations to ongoing dialogue  

### Level 2. System maturity

Six themes assessed from Level 1 (Beginning) to Level 5 (Mastering):

- Uses  
- Data  
- Leadership  
- Culture  
- Tools  
- Skills  

### Level 3. Outcomes

Indicators influenced by Levels 1 and 2:

- Financial savings  
- Efficiency gains  
- Time savings  
- User satisfaction  
- Public good impact  

---

## 3. Leading, signal and lagging indicators

To keep expectations realistic:

- Leading indicators show early progress in foundations  
- Signal indicators reflect system behaviour and maturity  
- Lagging indicators measure outcomes and benefits  

---

## 4. Executive decision box

A dedicated panel on Page 1 highlights:

- Top three asks  
- Trade offs  
- Dependencies  
- Evidence confidence  
- Forward look priorities  

This turns the dashboard into a decision tool.

---

## 5. Measurement methods

The Methodology page outlines practical evidence cycles:

- Monthly dashboards  
- Quarterly leadership updates  
- Annual maturity reviews  
- Staff surveys  
- Standards and policy adoption  
- API and platform analytics  
- Dataset and model reuse  
- Benefit tracking  
- BCR and NPV analysis  
- Counterfactual or experimental methods  

---

## 6. Why the model works

The model follows simple system principles:

- Foundations move faster than maturity  
- Maturity develops faster than outcomes  
- Outcomes lag the most  
- Maturity cannot exceed foundational strength  
- Public value emerges from alignment  
- Feedback loops refine future foundations  

---

## 7. How this model is used

Teams use this model to:

- Explain data strategy impact  
- Provide a consistent narrative for senior leaders  
- Prioritise effort across Levels 1 and 2  
- Compare directorates or ALBs  
- Integrate strategy, finance, policy and governance  

Used by:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- Portfolio, PMO and governance forums  
- Strategy and policy partners  
- Finance, benefits and performance leads

## 8. Repository contents

- HTML dashboard (Dashboard and Methodology pages)  
- Excel input template  
- PowerPoint generator script  
- Light architecture notes  
- Synthetic datasets  
- Optional Streamlit app  

---

## 9. Status

- Completed: HTML dashboard  
- In progress: Excel template and PowerPoint generator  
- Planned: Streamlit app  

---

## 10. Limitations

- All data is synthetic  
- The dashboard is a facilitation tool, not a formal scorecard  
- It is not an official benchmark or standard  
- Decisions require local evidence and professional judgement  

---

## 11. Tailoring the dashboard for different contexts

This model is adaptable. Different audiences and organisations need different versions.

### For senior executives  
- Keep the view high level  
- Emphasise the Executive Decision Box  
- Use leading and lagging indicators  
- Highlight risks, asks and trade offs  

### For data leaders and PMO teams  
- Expand Level 1 and Level 2 indicators  
- Link metrics to roadmap milestones  
- Include standards, platform adoption and reuse signals  

### For federated directorates or ALBs  
- Segment maturity by business area  
- Show variation and adoption gaps  
- Support local priorities  

### For practitioners and communities  
- Provide drill downs  
- Add training, platform and local metrics  
- Treat indicators as learning signals  

---

### Tailoring by organisation type

- Central departments: focus on shared platforms and cross cutting shifts  
- Federated groups or NDPBs: prioritise alignment and dependencies  

---

### Interpretation considerations

- Attribution is approximate  
- Evidence quality varies  
- Maturity scores are directional  
- Outcomes lag by years  
- Measurement capability increases over time  
- Some indicators will require adaptation

## 12. Contributing and reuse

You may fork, adapt or extend this model.  
Attribution is optional but appreciated.
