## 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

Public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the link between data work and real impact is often unclear.

Foundational activities are essential, yet their contribution to maturity and outcomes is hard to see.  

That leads to unclear expectations, late value signals and uneven support.

**ValueLine brings together a causal model, an action focussed dashboard and a lightweight methodology that show where value is emerging, where maturity is shifting and where leadership action is needed.**

It turns data strategy into something live and usable - providing early signals of what is shifting beneath the surface and creating a shared picture of progress across a federated organisation, reducing narrative drift and making alignment easier to sustain.

---

## 1. What problem this model solves

In federated organisations, no single team controls the full data value chain.  
This creates persistent challenges:

- **Unclear attribution** between foundational work and outcomes  
- **Competing priorities** that dilute focus  
- **Fragmented collaboration** across teams and functions  

When the line of sight is weak, organisations:

- focus effort in the wrong places  
- misread progress  
- invest without addressing root causes  
- create short-term fixes that become long-term bottlenecks  
- experience delayed or diluted impact  

### How ValueLine addresses this

ValueLine breaks the journey into three causal levels:

- **Level 1: Foundations** — what data and partner teams directly shape  
- **Level 2: Maturity** — how the organisation behaves when foundations take hold  
- **Level 3: Outcomes** — the measurable value that emerges later  

This helps leaders understand:

- what unlocks value now vs later  
- why early signals matter even when outcomes lag  
- where dependencies and decisions sit  
- how different results move at different speeds  

---

### ❗ What ValueLine isn’t

To avoid confusion, ValueLine is **not**:

- a valuation framework  
- a capability or maturity model (e.g., DAMA, DCAM)  
- a regulatory or compliance scorecard  
- a substitute for technical standards, governance or assurance  

ValueLine does **not** estimate economic value, audit capability or assign scores.

Its purpose is simpler:  
> to accelerate the path to value by explaining how foundational work leads to maturity, behaviour change and outcomes in federated organisations.

---

## 2. How the model works

ValueLine combines three levels, three indicators and three measurement methods, all tied together by a simple theory of change.

---

### 2.1 The three levels — what changes over time

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, leadership buy-in, shared capabilities, communities, consistent engagement.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
Reuse, interoperability, confidence, evidence-informed decisions, stronger collaboration.

**Level 3 — Outcomes**  
Savings, time reduction, efficiency, improved services, public good impact.

> A clean chain: foundations → maturity → outcomes & impact.

---

### 2.2 The three indicators — how fast results appear

**Leading indicators** — early signs foundations are forming  
**Signal indicators** — behavioural and system changes  
**Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

> These explain why Level 3 cannot appear before Level 1 and Level 2 shifts.

---

### 2.3 The three measurement methods — how evidence builds

ValueLine uses a mixed evidence approach:

- **Quantitative** — savings, adoption, reuse, usage  
- **Qualitative** — sentiment, user research, case studies  
- **Economic/experimental** — BCR, NPV, counterfactuals  

> No single metric provides the full picture.

---

### 2.4 Theory of change wrapper — the connective logic

- **If** foundations improve  
- **then** maturity strengthens  
- **which enables** outcomes to appear  
- **subject to** leadership decisions, constraints and system conditions  

> This turns ValueLine into a decision tool rather than a descriptive diagram.

---

## 3. Leadership value & responsibilities

### **3.1 What leaders get from ValueLine**

The **Executive Decision Box** distils insights into what leaders need to steer the system:

- essential decisions  
- trade offs and dependencies  
- confidence levels  
- now / next / later priorities  

It also **makes early change visible** — often the key trigger for building confidence, shifting mindsets and accelerating organisational change.

---

### **3.2 What ValueLine needs from leaders**

ValueLine only works when leaders act on what it surfaces. This typically requires:

- clear ownership of data domains and standards  
- balancing trade off between shared foundations and local optimisation  
- timely resolution of cross-team dependencies  
- align resources and be willing to retire duplicative tools and processes when common capabilities exist
- consistent reinforcement of reuse, interoperability and data led decisions  

Without these leadership behaviours, foundations stall and outcomes lag, regardless of technical effort.

---

## 4. Why this model works

ValueLine works because it:

- reflects how federated organisations actually operate  
- clarifies contribution vs attribution  
- sets realistic expectations on pacing  
- makes invisible value visible  
- focuses attention on the shifts that matter most  
- reduces misaligned effort and strengthens collaboration  

Most importantly, it keeps strategy **alive**.  
By showing emerging signals of change, ValueLine prevents strategy becoming shelfware and turns it into a living tool for alignment and action.

---

## 5. How to use the model in practice

ValueLine helps teams:

- explain data strategy impact clearly and credibly  
- engage leaders with realistic pacing and evidence  
- prioritise foundations vs maturity work  
- align directorates and ALBs without league tables  

Useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- PMO, governance and portfolio groups  
- strategy, policy and finance partners  
- change, performance and benefits teams

## 10. Why I created ValueLine

Across federated teams and dozens of data strategies, I kept seeing the same pattern:

- strong foundational work  
- unclear value story  
- drifting expectations  
- late value signals  
- weak connection between foundations, maturity and outcomes  

ValueLine is my way of making that connection clearer and more usable, shaped through trial and error, reflection and generous guidance from colleagues.

If it helps teams focus on what matters and communicate impact with greater confidence, it will have done its job.

If useful, here is a short talk where I share some of the thinking that influenced this model:
