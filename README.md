<h1 align="center">Data Strategy Impact Dashboard</h1>

<p align="center">
  A simple three level framework to help public sector data leaders explain, track and demonstrate 
  data strategy impact in complex or federated organisations.
</p>

---

> ### 📌 Concept in 30 seconds
> A reusable model that helps public sector data leaders explain **how data strategy activity (Level 1)**  
> leads to **data maturity (Level 2)** and ultimately **public value outcomes (Level 3)**.  
>  
> It creates a **clear causal chain**, provides a **repeatable dashboard**, and enables better  
> **executive conversations, prioritisation and investment decisions** across federated organisations.

---

## 1. What the model solves  
Most public sector organisations find it difficult to show how data strategy activity leads to maturity and then to outcomes.  
The problem is attribution.  
Data teams often control the inputs but not the outcomes.

This model brings clarity by structuring the story into three causal levels:

1. **Level 1. Build the foundational enablers**  
   Conditions that data leaders and teams directly control.  
   These include strategy alignment, shared leadership, foundations, community, engagement.

2. **Level 2. Enable maturity**  
   How the wider system behaves when Level 1 is working.  
   Uses, data, leadership, culture, tools and skills all develop toward a more capable and sustainable data ecosystem.

3. **Level 3. Influence outcomes**  
   Public value created when maturity is in place.  
   Financial savings, user satisfaction, time savings, operational efficiency, and public good contributions.

This creates a clean chain of reasoning:  
**Level 1 activities produce Level 2 maturity which shapes Level 3 outcomes.**

## 2. The three levels at a glance

### Level 1. Build the foundational enablers  
Conditions under direct control. These unlock maturity.  
Examples:  
- Cross cutting data priorities  
- Shared ownership and decision making  
- Common foundations and standards  
- Strong data communities  
- Cross functional engagement

### Level 2. Enable maturity  
System capability that emerges from earlier Level 1.  
This builds on Government Data Maturity Framework (2023) with maturity rating ranging from Level 1 (Beginning) to Level 5 (Mastering) for following suc themes:
- Uses  
- Data  
- Leadership  
- Culture  
- Tools  
- Skills

### Level 3. Influence outcomes  
Public value indicators influenced by the first two levels:  
- Financial savings  
- User satisfaction  
- Efficiency gains  
- Time savings  
- Public good impact across government

---

## 3. Leading, signal and lagging indicators  
Each metric is classified so expectations are realistic:

- **Leading**: Early signs that enablers are working  
- **Signal**: System response and behaviour change  
- **Lagging**: Measurable public value and benefits

This prevents unrealistic pressure to show outcomes before foundations are in place.

---

## 4. Executive decision box  
A dedicated space where leaders see:  
- Top three asks  
- Dependencies  
- Trade offs  
- Confidence levels  
- Forward look priorities

This translates data strategy into executive action and ownership.

---

## 5. Measurement methods  
Recommended measurement cycles include:  
- Monthly performance reports  
- Quarterly senior leadership updates  
- Annual maturity review  
- Annual staff survey  
- Event and training participation  
- Standards adoption  
- Dataset and model reuse  
- Open data analytics  
- Post implementation reviews  
- Verified cost and time savings

These give a balanced picture of value creation and capability building.

---

## 6. How this model is used  
This framework helps public sector teams:  
- Explain data strategy impact in a simple causal chain  
- Engage leaders using a consistent, repeatable format  
- Identify where to invest effort next  
- Benchmark directorates or ALBs in federated departments  
- Move discussions away from “where are the outcomes” to  
  “are the enablers and system conditions in place”

---

## 7. What this repository provides  
- Interactive HTML dashboard  
- Excel input template  
- PowerPoint generator script  
- Architecture documentation  
- Example synthetic datasets  
- Streamlit app (optional)

---

## Limitations

- All data and examples are **synthetic**  
- The dashboard is a **learning and facilitation tool**, not an official scorecard  
- Real decisions should still draw on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement  

Please adapt this with care and make sure any real figures are checked and agreed locally.

## Contributing and reuse

You are welcome to:

- Fork this and build your own version  
- Open issues or pull requests with improvements  
- Share alternative layouts or additional metrics to help other public sector teams  

If you reuse it, you do not need to credit the source, but a short note back is always appreciated.

## Author

Created by **Bandhu P. Das**, public sector data leader, qualified accountant, Imperial AI policy fellow 2025 and former DAMA UK committee member (2023-2024).

🎤 **BrightTalk Talk — “Unlocking the Value of Data - Lessons from Public Sector Data Business Cases”**  
https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/12405/602410

In this session, Bandhu explains why proving the value of data work is difficult in practice — especially in federated public sector organisations. He introduces the **Value Matrix**, a practical extension of the Treasury’s Five Case Model that incorporates engagement and change as essential enablers of impact.

Drawing on 15+ years across finance, policy and data, Bandhu discusses:  
- why ROI and cost-benefit analysis only capture part of data’s value  
- how to articulate multi-dimensional benefits stakeholders can recognise  
- how to build high impact data business cases that secure investment  
- lessons from Defra and HM Treasury on creating enterprise level value  

This dashboard builds on the same principles: making data strategy, maturity and public value **visible, explainable and fundable** in complex organisations.
