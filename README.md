> ### 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

> ValueLine shows how foundational data work (Level 1) shapes maturity and system behaviour (Level 2) and ultimately drives public value outcomes (Level 3).  
> It gives leaders a clear causal chain and a reusable dashboard to compare options, understand time horizons and choose faster paths to value in federated environments.  
> It shifts the conversation from “why is value slow?” to “which conditions and levers deliver value now, next and later?”

## 1. What the model solves

Most public sector organisations struggle to show how data strategy activity leads to maturity and, ultimately, to outcomes.  
The core problem is attribution: data teams influence the inputs, but not the outcomes or the speed at which they emerge.

**ValueLine** brings clarity by structuring the story into **three causal levels**, each operating on **different time horizons** and with **different degrees of control**.  
This helps leaders understand where value can be realised quickly, where it takes longer and what choices accelerate progress.

### Level 1. Build the foundational enablers
- Conditions that data leaders and teams directly influence.  
- These move fastest because they relate to alignment, governance, design, capability and early cultural shifts.  
- They give leaders **early signals of progress**, even before maturity and outcomes change.

### Level 2. Enable maturity
- How the wider system behaves when Level 1 is working.  
- This takes longer because it depends on adoption, behaviour change, leadership reinforcement and real-world use of data.  
- Leaders can accelerate maturity through sponsorship, prioritisation, joined up governance and aligning incentives.

### Level 3. Influence outcomes
- Where public value becomes visible.  
- These take the longest because outcomes rely on cross-organisational change, partner incentives, operational cycles and external factors.  
- The model helps leaders explain the time lag, set expectations and show how today’s foundations protect and grow tomorrow’s value.

The model creates a clean causal chain:  
**Level 1 activities shape Level 2 maturity, which influences Level 3 outcomes — each on its own timeline, but all able to create value.**

## Demonstrating value over time: a practical model for data leaders

Because outcomes appear later than foundational work, the model helps data leaders:

- show early signals of value through foundational progress  
- demonstrate system improvements as maturity builds  
- align expectations with peers on where outcomes will realistically appear  
- make informed choices to accelerate impact where it matters most


## Caveat – scope and boundaries

This dashboard focuses on the direct and near term effects of organisational data strategy work.  
It is designed to show how foundational activity improves system conditions and maturity over time, not to capture every form of value a data ecosystem can create.

It does not serve as a data valuation framework and does not estimate wider social, environmental or economic value.  
It is also not intended for sector wide or national data strategies, where incentives, scale, partners and value mechanisms differ significantly.

### Regulatory obligations vs strategic value  
Many teams already manage data effectively for compliance, audit and legal purposes.  
Compliance protects integrity and reduces risk, but **compliance is not the same as value**.  
Strategy work focuses on the **conditions that enable data to be reused, connected and translated into improved maturity and future outcomes**.


## 2. The three levels at a glance

### Level 1. Enabler shift 
Early conditions shaped by data leaders and teams.  
Examples vary by organisation and context, but typically involve shifting from:

- **Strategy** – isolated priorities and disconnected efforts → shared direction and a small set of cross-cutting data priorities  
- **Leadership** – “their data problem” → shared ownership, shared accountability and shared decision-making  
- **Foundation** – fragmented fixes and inconsistent practices → common platforms, common standards and common reference data  
- **Communities** – pockets of innovation → shared practice and reusable capabilties 
- **Engagement** – ad-hoc conversations → ongoing dialogue across functions and organisations  

### Level 2. Maturity shift

Level 2 describes how the organisation behaves when Level 1 foundations begin to take effect. 

It uses the six themes from the Data Maturity Assessment for Government (2023).

- **Uses** - From data used mainly for reactive reporting  to data used proactively to inform operational and strategic decisions.

- **Data** - From siloed, inconsistent and hard to combine datasets  to coherent, reusable and well governed data assets with interoperability.

- **Leadership** - From leaders viewing data issues as technical or administrative to leaders actively championing data, setting expectations and investing in capability.

- **Culture** - From low confidence and sporadic use of data to a culture where data is part of everyday decision making and shared responsibility.

- **Tools** - From fragmented tools and workaround heavy environments to integrated, discoverable and fit-for-purpose tools that support self service and reuse.

- **Skills** - From pockets of expertise concentrated in specialist teams to widespread data literacy and continuous capability development across roles.

### Level 3. Outcome shift

As Level 1 foundations strengthen and Level 2 behaviours mature, the pattern of public value shifts in predictable ways.

- **Financial savings** - From isolated savings in specific teams to sustained, organisation wide savings supported by reliable evidence.

- **User satisfaction** - From anecdotal or inconsistent feedback to measurable and repeatable improvements in user experience.

- **Efficiency gains** - From small local efficiency wins to significant, system level efficiency improvements in core processes.

- **Time savings** - From individual tasks being reduced or automated to end-to-end time reductions across services and workflows.

- **Public good impact** - From occasional high impact cases to continuous and measurable contributions to policy, service delivery and citizen outcomes.

These shifts describe how value grows as the organisation becomes more mature and aligned.

## 3. Leading, signal and lagging indicators  

Each metric is classified so expectations are realistic:

- **Leading**: Early signs that enablers are working (mainly Level 1)  
- **Signal**: System response and behaviour change (mainly Level 2)  
- **Lagging**: Measurable public value and benefits (mainly Level 3)  

This helps avoid unrealistic pressure to show outcomes before foundations are in place.

---

## 4. Executive decision box  

The dashboard includes an **Executive decision box** to the right of Page 1.

This provides a dedicated space for leaders to see:

- Top three asks  
- Key trade offs  
- Dependencies  
- Confidence levels in the evidence  
- Forward look priorities  

This translates data strategy into **concrete executive decisions and ownership**, instead of a generic performance report.

---

## 5. Measurement methods  

The Methodology page suggests practical measurement cycles, for example:

- Monthly performance reports  
- Quarterly senior leadership updates  
- Annual maturity review  
- Annual staff survey  
- Event and training participation  
- Policy and Standards adoption rates
- Dataset and model reuse  
- Open data and API analytics  
- Verified cost and time savings using benefit trackers
- Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Net Present Value (NPV) analysis
- Randomised controlled trials and counterfactuals 
  
These give a balanced picture of both **capability building** and **value creation**.

## 6. Why this three level model works  

Behind the dashboard is a simple systems principle: **foundations shape maturity, and maturity shapes outcomes**.

This approach works because:

- foundations and outcomes move at different speeds  
- system behaviour lags behind system investment  
- maturity cannot exceed the strength of foundations  
- outcomes cannot exceed the maturity level  
- public value emerges from alignment, not random effort  
- the system is iterative, not linear  
- feedback from outcomes reshapes future foundations    

These principles explain the structure of the dashboard and why it uses leading, signal and lagging indicators.

## 7. How this model is used  

This framework helps public sector teams:

- Explain data strategy impact using a simple causal chain  
- Engage senior leaders using a consistent, repeatable dashboard  
- Identify where to invest effort next in Level 1 or Level 2  
- Compare directorates or ALBs within federated departments  

It is particularly useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- Portfolio, PMO and governance forums  
- Strategy, finance and policy partners  
- Internal performance and benefits leads

- Attribution is approximate
- Evidence quality varies
- Maturity scores are directional
- Outcomes lag by years
- Measurement improves over time
- Real decisions should still draw on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement  

Please adapt this with care and make sure you take into account the needs of decision makers..

## 12. Creator

ValueLine is created by **Bandhu P. Das**, public sector data leader, qualified accountant, DAMA UK Committee Member (2023-24) and Imperial AI Policy Fellow (2025).

The model reflects a recurring challenge across organisations: data teams were doing the right work, but the **right measurements and right actions** were often unclear or inconsistent. After many conversations and reviewing 50+ strategies and business cases, a common pattern emerged.

ValueLine is a practical way to link foundational work to maturity, and maturity to outcomes and impact, helping teams focus effort where it matters most.

> This model builds on ideas I shared in my 2023 DAMA UK talk, *“Unlocking the Value of Data.”*
