<h1 align="center">ValueLine: Data Strategy Impact Dashboard</h1>

<p align="center">
  A three level causal model to help public sector data leaders explain, track and demonstrate 
  data strategy impact in complex or federated organisations.
</p>

---

> ### 📌 Concept in 30 seconds
> This dashboard shows how data strategy activity and foundations (Level 1) lead to data maturity and system behaviour (Level 2) and ultimately public value outcomes (Level 3).  

> It provides a clear causal chain, a repeatable dashboard format, and a better way to have executive conversations, prioritise effort and make choices in federated organisations. 

> It facilitates shifting discussions away from “where are the outcomes” toward
“are the enablers and system conditions in place.”

## 1. What the model solves  

Most public sector organisations find it difficult to show how data strategy activity leads to maturity and then to outcomes.  

The problem is attribution. Data teams usually control the inputs, but not the outcomes.

This model brings clarity by structuring the story into three causal levels:

1. **Level 1. Build the foundational enablers**  
   Conditions that data leaders and teams directly control.  
   These are co-designed and contextual. This example includes strategy alignment, shared leadership, common foundations, grassroots community and cross-functional engagement.

2. **Level 2. Enable maturity**  
   How the wider system behaves when Level 1 is working.  
   Uses, data, leadership, culture, tools and skills develop toward a more capable and sustainable data ecosystem.

3. **Level 3. Influence outcomes**  
   Public value created when maturity is in place.  
   Financial savings, user satisfaction, time savings, operational efficiency and public good contributions.

This creates a clean chain of reasoning:  
**Level 1 activities shape Level 2 maturity, which influences Level 3 outcomes.**

## 2. The three levels at a glance

### Level 1. Enabler shift 
Early conditions shaped by data leaders and teams.  
Examples vary by organisation and context, but typically involve shifting from:

- **Strategy** – isolated priorities and disconnected efforts → shared direction and a small set of cross-cutting data priorities  
- **Leadership** – “their data problem” → shared ownership, shared accountability and shared decision-making  
- **Foundation** – fragmented fixes and inconsistent practices → common platforms, common standards and common reference data  
- **Communities** – pockets of innovation → shared practice and reusable capabilties 
- **Engagement** – ad-hoc conversations → ongoing dialogue across functions and organisations  

### Level 2. Maturity shift

Level 2 describes how the organisation behaves when Level 1 foundations begin to take effect. 

It uses the six themes from the Data Maturity Assessment for Government (2023).

- **Uses** - From data used mainly for reactive reporting  to data used proactively to inform operational and strategic decisions.

- **Data** - From siloed, inconsistent and hard to combine datasets  to coherent, reusable and well governed data assets with interoperability.

- **Leadership** - From leaders viewing data issues as technical or administrative to leaders actively championing data, setting expectations and investing in capability.

- **Culture** - From low confidence and sporadic use of data to a culture where data is part of everyday decision making and shared responsibility.

- **Tools** - From fragmented tools and workaround heavy environments to integrated, discoverable and fit-for-purpose tools that support self service and reuse.

- **Skills** - From pockets of expertise concentrated in specialist teams to widespread data literacy and continuous capability development across roles.

### Level 3. Outcome shift

As Level 1 foundations strengthen and Level 2 behaviours mature, the pattern of public value shifts in predictable ways.

- **Financial savings** - From isolated savings in specific teams to sustained, organisation wide savings supported by reliable evidence.

- **User satisfaction** - From anecdotal or inconsistent feedback to measurable and repeatable improvements in user experience.

- **Efficiency gains** - From small local efficiency wins to significant, system level efficiency improvements in core processes.

- **Time savings** - From individual tasks being reduced or automated to end-to-end time reductions across services and workflows.

- **Public good impact** - From occasional high impact cases to continuous and measurable contributions to policy, service delivery and citizen outcomes.

These shifts describe how value grows as the organisation becomes more mature and aligned.

## 3. Leading, signal and lagging indicators  

Each metric is classified so expectations are realistic:

- **Leading**: Early signs that enablers are working (mainly Level 1)  
- **Signal**: System response and behaviour change (mainly Level 2)  
- **Lagging**: Measurable public value and benefits (mainly Level 3)  

This helps avoid unrealistic pressure to show outcomes before foundations are in place.

---

## 4. Executive decision box  

The dashboard includes an **Executive decision box** to the right of Page 1.

This provides a dedicated space for leaders to see:

- Top three asks  
- Key trade offs  
- Dependencies  
- Confidence levels in the evidence  
- Forward look priorities  

This translates data strategy into **concrete executive decisions and ownership**, instead of a generic performance report.

---

## 5. Measurement methods  

The Methodology page suggests practical measurement cycles, for example:

- Monthly performance reports  
- Quarterly senior leadership updates  
- Annual maturity review  
- Annual staff survey  
- Event and training participation  
- Policy and Standards adoption rates
- Dataset and model reuse  
- Open data and API analytics  
- Verified cost and time savings using benefit trackers
- Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Net Present Value (NPV) analysis
- Randomised controlled trials and counterfactuals 
  
These give a balanced picture of both **capability building** and **value creation**.

## 6. Why this three level model works  

Behind the dashboard is a simple systems principle: **foundations shape maturity, and maturity shapes outcomes**.

This approach works because:

- foundations and outcomes move at different speeds  
- system behaviour lags behind system investment  
- maturity cannot exceed the strength of foundations  
- outcomes cannot exceed the maturity level  
- public value emerges from alignment, not random effort  
- the system is iterative, not linear  
- feedback from outcomes reshapes future foundations    

These principles explain the structure of the dashboard and why it uses leading, signal and lagging indicators.

## 7. How this model is used  

This framework helps public sector teams:

- Explain data strategy impact using a simple causal chain  
- Engage senior leaders using a consistent, repeatable dashboard  
- Identify where to invest effort next in Level 1 or Level 2  
- Compare directorates or ALBs within federated departments  

It is particularly useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- Portfolio, PMO and governance forums  
- Strategy, finance and policy partners  
- Internal performance and benefits leads

## 10. Limitations  

- All data and examples are **synthetic**  
- The dashboard is a learning and facilitation tool, not an official scorecard  
- It is not a benchmark, standard or assurance framework  
- Attribution is approximate
- Evidence quality varies
- Maturity scores are directional
- Outcomes lag by years
- Measurement improves over time
- Real decisions should still draw on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement  

Please adapt this with care and make sure you take into account the needs of decision makers..
