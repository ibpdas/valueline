# Concept in 30 seconds

Public sector data leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the link between **foundational work** and **real outcomes** is often unclear.  
Foundations are invisible, maturity develops unevenly, and outcomes appear late.  
This leads to duplicated effort, drifting expectations and slower value creation.

**ValueLine makes this path visible.**

It combines a **strategic logic model**, a **diagnostic & prioritisation tool**, and a **performance & learning system** to show:

- how foundations → maturity → outcomes connect  
- where early value is emerging  
- where leadership attention is needed  
- how federated teams can stay aligned  

ValueLine turns data strategy into a *practical*, *living* decision tool.

---

# 1. The problem ValueLine solves

In federated organisations, no single team controls the full data value chain. This creates persistent challenges:

- unclear attribution between foundational work and outcomes  
- competing local priorities  
- fragmented collaboration  
- narrative drift on progress  
- delayed or inconsistent value signals  

When the line of sight is weak, organisations:

- prioritise the wrong things  
- misread progress  
- invest without tackling root causes  
- create fixes that later become blockers  
- struggle to scale impact beyond pilots  

---

## What ValueLine provides

ValueLine brings together **three integrated capabilities**:

### **1. Strategic logic model**  
Clarifies how foundations strengthen maturity and enable outcomes.

### **2. Diagnostic & prioritisation tool**  
Identifies the critical shifts that unlock progress and focus effort.

### **3. Performance & learning system**  
Builds a credible, mixed-method picture of value.

Together, these help leaders understand:

- what drives value now vs later  
- where bottlenecks sit  
- how early signals indicate movement  
- which actions accelerate outcomes  
- how federated teams stay aligned  

---

## What ValueLine isn’t

ValueLine is **not**:

- a maturity scorecard  
- a valuation framework  
- a compliance tool  
- a governance substitute  

It does **not** estimate economic benefits, assign maturity scores or replace assurance.  
Instead, it uses quantitative, qualitative and experimental evidence to build a balanced and credible picture of progress.

Its purpose is simpler:

> **To accelerate value creation by making the causal logic clear and actionable.**

---

# 2. How ValueLine works

ValueLine is built on **three integrated components**, aligned with the ValueLine visual.

---

## 2.1 Strategic logic model — Focus on the right things

The strategic logic model explains the **causal path** from foundations to outcomes.

### **The three levels**

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, shared ownership, common platforms and standards, communities and engagement.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
Reuse, interoperability, confident culture, collaboration and evidence-informed decisions.

**Level 3 — Outcomes & impact**  
Savings, efficiency, time reduction, service quality and public good impact.

> A clean chain: **foundations → maturity → outcomes & impact**.

---

### **Theory of change**

A lightweight theory of change underpins progress:

- If **Level 1** improves  
- then **Level 2** strengthens  
- which enables **Level 3** outcomes  
- **when leadership, incentives and system conditions reinforce intended shifts**

This turns the logic model into a practical decision tool.

---

## 2.2 Diagnostic & prioritisation tool — Accelerate value creation

This component identifies **where the system is moving**, **why**, and **what matters next**.

It uses **shifts** to interpret movement and **indicators** to understand pacing.

---

### **Shifts — early signs of meaningful change**

ValueLine focuses on **shifts**, not scores.  
Shifts reveal whether the organisation is genuinely moving in the right direction.

---

### **Level 1 — Foundational enabler shifts**

These five enablers represent the essential building blocks shaped by data leadership and partner teams:

- **Strategy** — isolated priorities → shared, cross-cutting priorities  
- **Leadership** — “their data problem” → shared ownership and accountability  
- **Foundation (platforms, standards, policies)** — fragmented fixes → common platforms, standards and reusable components  
- **Community** — pockets of innovation → shared practice, knowledge exchange and reusable assets  
- **Engagement** — ad-hoc conversations → ongoing cross-functional engagement and collaboration  

---

### **Level 2 — Maturity shifts**

Aligned to the **six Data Maturity Themes** used across government:

- **Uses** — reactive reporting → proactive, integrated use  
- **Data** — inconsistent → coherent, reusable and interoperable  
- **Leadership** — passive → active sponsorship and expectation-setting  
- **Culture** — low confidence → everyday data-informed decisions  
- **Tools** — fragmented → discoverable, integrated and self-service  
- **Skills** — pockets of expertise → widespread literacy and continuous learning  

---

### **Level 3 — Outcome & impact shifts**

- isolated wins → organisation wide efficiencies  
- anecdotal satisfaction → measurable improvements  
- task-based efficiency → end to end optimisation  
- occasional public good impact → continuous contributions to policy and services  

---

### **Indicators — understanding pacing**

- **Leading indicators** — early signs foundations are forming  
- **Signal indicators** — behavioural and system changes  
- **Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

These differences prevent premature pressure on outcomes before the system is ready.

---

## 2.3 Performance & learning system — Measure what matters

ValueLine uses a **mixed-method evidence model** to build a rounded, credible picture of progress.

### **Evidence types**

- **Quantitative** — adoption, reuse, usage, cost reduction, NPV, BCRs  
- **Qualitative** — sentiment, interviews, case studies, user research  
- **Experimental** — counterfactuals, controlled comparisons, before / after tests   

No single metric captures capability or value.  
Mixed evidence creates a **more robust and less fragile** narrative.

---

# 3. Leadership value & responsibilities

### **What leaders gain**

- a root cause view of what’s enabling or blocking progress  
- confidence levels  
- dependencies and pacing  
- now / next / later priorities  
- structured trade offs  

### **What ValueLine requires from leaders**

ValueLine works when leaders:

- reinforce shared foundations over local optimisation  
- confirm ownership and decision rights  
- unblock dependencies  
- retire duplicative tools  
- role model evidence informed decision making  

---

# 4. Why ValueLine works

ValueLine reflects how change happens in complex public-sector systems:

- foundations matter, but take time  
- maturity emerges unevenly  
- outcomes lag  
- early signals drive confidence  
- federated teams need coherence, not uniformity  

ValueLine succeeds because it:

- clarifies contribution  
- reduces misinterpretation  
- reveals early value  
- aligns expectations  
- keeps strategy alive and useful  

In federated systems, coherence is the goal.  
ValueLine provides the structure that makes it possible.

---

# 5. How to use the model

Different groups use ValueLine in different ways:

| Users | How they use it | What they focus on |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Executives** | Understand causes, steer direction | Priorities, trade-offs, outcomes |
| **CDO & data leaders** | Shape foundations, track shifts | Dependencies, sequencing |
| **PMO, Finance, Benefits** | Connect work → outcomes | Evidence, duplication, rationale |
| **Delivery teams** | Understand their role in the system | Adoption, blockers, reuse |
| **Federated partners** | Shared view without league tables | Coherence, autonomy, transparency |

---

### **Using ValueLine in sessions**

1. Start with Levels 1 → 2 → 3  
2. Review shifts and early signals  
3. Explore indicators in order (leading → signal → lagging)  
4. Use **bias prompts** to reduce misinterpretation  

This strengthens decision hygiene and avoids false confidence.

# 10. Why I created ValueLine

Across federated teams and multiple data strategies, I kept seeing:

- strong foundational work  
- unclear value stories  
- drifting expectations  
- late signals  
- weak connection between foundations → maturity → outcomes  

ValueLine is my attempt to make that connection clearer, earlier and more actionable.
