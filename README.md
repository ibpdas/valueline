## 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

Public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but the link between data work and real impact is often unclear.  

Foundational activities are essential, yet their contribution to maturity and outcomes is hard to see.  

That leads to misaligned expectations, duplicated effort, slower impact and results that are harder to sustain.

> ValueLine brings together a causal model, a delivery focussed dashboard and a lightweight methodology to show where value is emerging, how maturity is shifting and where leadership action is needed to accelerate the path to impact.

It turns data strategy into something *live and usable* — surfacing early signals of change and creating a shared picture of progress across a federated organisation, reducing narrative drift and making alignment easier to sustain.

---

## 1. What problem this model solves

In federated organisations, no single team controls the full data value chain.  
This creates persistent challenges:

- **Unclear attribution** between foundational work and outcomes  
- **Competing priorities** that dilute focus  
- **Fragmented collaboration** across teams and functions  

When the line of sight is weak, organisations:

- focus effort in the wrong places  
- misread progress  
- invest without addressing root causes  
- create short-term fixes that become long-term bottlenecks  
- experience delayed or diluted impact  

### How ValueLine addresses this

ValueLine breaks the journey into three causal levels:

- **Level 1: Foundations** — what data and partner teams directly shape  
- **Level 2: Maturity** — how the organisation behaves when foundations take hold  
- **Level 3: Outcomes** — the measurable value that emerges later  

This helps leaders understand:

- what unlocks value now vs later  
- why early signals matter even when outcomes lag  
- where dependencies and decisions sit  
- how different results move at different speeds  

---

### ❗ What ValueLine isn’t

To avoid confusion, ValueLine is **not**:

- a valuation framework  
- a capability or maturity model (e.g., DAMA, DCAM)  
- a regulatory or compliance scorecard  
- a substitute for technical standards, governance or assurance  

ValueLine does **not** estimate economic value, audit capability or assign scores.

Its purpose is simpler:  
> to accelerate the path to value by explaining how foundational work leads to maturity, behaviour change and outcomes in federated organisations.

---

## 2. How the model works

ValueLine combines three levels, three indicators and three measurement methods, all tied together by a simple theory of change.

---

### 2.1 The three levels — what changes over time

**Level 1 — Foundations**  
Strategy alignment, leadership buy-in, shared capabilities, communities, consistent engagement.

**Level 2 — Maturity**  
Reuse, interoperability, confidence, evidence-informed decisions, stronger collaboration.

**Level 3 — Outcomes**  
Savings, time reduction, efficiency, improved services, public good impact.

> A clean chain: foundations → maturity → outcomes & impact.

---

### 2.2 The three indicators — how fast results appear

**Leading indicators** — early signs foundations are forming  
**Signal indicators** — behavioural and system changes  
**Lagging indicators** — measurable public value  

> These explain why Level 3 cannot appear before Level 1 and Level 2 shifts.

---

### 2.3 The three measurement methods — how evidence builds

ValueLine uses a mixed evidence approach:

- **Quantitative** — savings, adoption, reuse, usage  
- **Qualitative** — sentiment, user research, case studies  
- **Economic/experimental** — BCR, NPV, counterfactuals  

> No single metric provides the full picture.

---

### 2.4 Theory of change wrapper — the connective logic

- **If** foundations improve  
- **then** maturity strengthens  
- **which enables** outcomes to appear  
- **subject to** leadership decisions, constraints and system conditions  

> This turns ValueLine into a decision tool rather than a descriptive diagram.

---
### 2.5 The three levels at a glance — the shifts that matter

ValueLine tracks **how the system shifts over time** as foundations strengthen and maturity increases.

#### **Level 1 — Foundational enabler shifts**  
Early conditions shaped by data leaders and partner teams. Typical shifts include:

- **Strategy** — isolated priorities → shared direction and cross-cutting data priorities  
- **Leadership** — “their data problem” → shared ownership and accountability  
- **Foundation** — fragmented fixes → common policies, platforms and standards  
- **Community** — pockets of innovation → shared practice and reusable capabilities  
- **Engagement** — ad-hoc conversations → ongoing cross-functional, cross-organisational engagement  

---

#### **Level 2 — Maturity shifts**  
How the organisation behaves when Level 1 foundations take effect (aligned to the *Data Maturity Assessment for Government, 2023*):

- **Uses** — reactive reporting → proactive operational and strategic use  
- **Data** — siloed/inconsistent → coherent, reusable, governed and interoperable  
- **Leadership** — passive/detached → active sponsorship and expectation-setting  
- **Culture** — sporadic/low-confidence → everyday data-informed decisions  
- **Tools** — fragmented → integrated, discoverable and self-service  
- **Skills** — pockets of expertise → widespread literacy and continuous development  

---

#### **Level 3 — Outcome and impact shifts**  
As Level 1 and 2 strengthen, public value moves in predictable ways:

- **Financial savings** — isolated wins → sustained, organisation-wide efficiencies  
- **User satisfaction** — anecdotal → measurable, repeatable improvements  
- **Efficiency gains** — local wins → system-wide improvements in core processes  
- **Time savings** — task-based → end-to-end workflow optimisation  
- **Public good impact** — occasional → continuous contributions to policy and service outcomes  

---

### 2.6 Bias prompts for interpretation

The dashboard includes a small set of **bias prompt cards**. These are not a full catalogue of cognitive biases, but simple reminders used when:

- interpreting maturity scores  
- choosing which ValueLine shifts to prioritise  
- framing trade offs in the Executive Decision Box  

Examples include the cobra effect, Goodhart's law, availability bias, present bias, sunk cost fallacy and optimism bias.  

Their aim is to make judgement risks visible and discussable, so that decisions about investment, sequencing and evidence are more grounded and transparent.

---

## 3. Leadership value & responsibilities

### **3.1 What leaders get from ValueLine**

The **Executive Decision Box** distils insights into what leaders need to steer the system:

- essential decisions  
- trade offs and dependencies  
- confidence levels  
- now / next / later priorities  

It also **makes early change visible** — often the key trigger for building confidence, shifting mindsets and accelerating organisational change.

---

### **3.2 What ValueLine needs from leaders**

ValueLine only works when leaders act on what it surfaces. This typically requires:

- clear ownership of data domains and standards  
- balancing trade off between shared foundations and local optimisation  
- timely resolution of cross-team dependencies  
- align resources and be willing to retire duplicative tools and processes when common capabilities exist
- consistent reinforcement of reuse, interoperability and data led decisions  

Without these leadership behaviours, foundations stall and outcomes lag, regardless of technical effort.

---

## 4. Why this model works

ValueLine works because it:

- reflects how federated organisations actually operate  
- clarifies contribution vs attribution  
- sets realistic expectations on pacing  
- makes invisible value visible  
- focuses attention on the shifts that matter most  
- reduces misaligned effort and strengthens collaboration  

Most importantly, it keeps strategy **alive**.  
By showing emerging signals of change, ValueLine prevents strategy becoming shelfware and turns it into a living tool for alignment and action.

---

## 5. How to use the model in practice

Different groups use the model in different ways depending on what they are accountable for.

| Group | How they use it | What they care about |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Executives and senior leaders** | Executive Decision Box and maturity/outcome signals | trade offs, prioritisation, confidence levels, pacing |
| **CDO and data leadership teams** | Foundations, shifts, sequencing, dependency mapping | alignment, realistic delivery plans, early signals, cross-team clarity |
| **Portfolio, PMO, finance and benefits teams** | Causal chain, indicators, contribution to impact | investment rationale, duplication, benefits evidence, coherence |
| **Cross-functional delivery teams** | Shifts + foundations to understand their part in the system | blockers, adoption, dependencies, reuse, interoperability |
| **ALBs and federated partners** | A consistent view of maturity and outcomes without league tables | autonomy with alignment, shared foundations, transparency, predictable collaboration |

---

### Using the dashboard in sessions

When running workshops or leadership conversations:

1. Start with the high level story (Levels 1, 2, 3).  
2. Walk through the Executive Decision Box.  
3. Review leading and signal indicators before lagging metrics.  
4. Use the **bias prompt cards** as a short decision hygiene step:  
   - “If this bias were present, how would it distort what we are seeing?”  

This keeps conversations grounded and reduces misinterpretation of early signals.

---

### Why this matters in federated organisations

Federated organisations rarely move as one system. Each directorate or ALB has its own pressures, timelines and constraints.  
ValueLine helps by creating a shared way to:

- make foundational work visible even when delivered by different teams  
- spot misaligned effort early  
- show how local wins connect to organisation-wide outcomes  
- reduce narrative drift when different groups interpret progress differently  
- keep expectations realistic without slowing ambition  

In a federated system, the goal is not uniformity.  
The goal is **coherence**. ValueLine provides the structure that makes that possible.

## 10. Why I created ValueLine

Across federated teams and dozens of data strategies, I kept seeing the same pattern:

- strong foundational work  
- unclear value story  
- drifting expectations  
- late value signals  
- weak connection between foundations, maturity and outcomes  

ValueLine is my way of making that connection clearer and more usable, shaped through trial and error, reflection and generous guidance from colleagues.

If it helps teams focus on what matters and communicate impact with greater confidence, it will have done its job.

If useful, here is a short talk where I share some of the thinking that influenced this model:
